MODIFICATIONS

This software has been modified from the original Pinboard Kotlin by zeroxbob
to support the Nostr protocol (NIP-B0) for decentralized bookmarking.

Key modifications include:
- Adapted data layer to work with Nostr relays instead of Pinboard/Linkding APIs
- Added vault encryption system (Argon2id + AES-256-GCM) for private bookmarks
- Integrated Amber signer (NIP-55) for authentication
- Modified domain models to support Nostr events and NIP-B0 bookmark structure
- Updated UI to support public/private bookmark distinction with encryption

The original architecture, UI components, database layer, and sync infrastructure
from Pinboard Kotlin have been preserved and are gratefully acknowledged.
